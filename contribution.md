# Contribution Guide

This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

Generally, we expect two maintainers to review your pull request before it is approved for merging. Please follow the guidelines below before submitting the pull request.

## Open Source Licenses

All models in the Model Asset Exchange are released under the [Apache License Version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or a similar open-source license. If releasing a pretrained model then the data must also be released under an open-source license such as the [Community Data License Agreement â€“ Sharing, Version 1.0 (CDLA-Sharing-1.0)](https://cdla.io/sharing-1-0/) (preferred) or [Creative Commons Share-Alike (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).


## Merge approval

Every pull request requires approval from one maintainer who is not the author of the pull request.

## Does the proposed model or code change have positive impact?

Pull requests that do not have a positive impact should be closed without merging. A positive impact is anything with a concrete improvement. A positive impact is a very broad concept and includes things as small as minor improvements in code readability and the UI. Still, some proposed changes may not impose a positive impact to the project. This usually happens when the change merely reflects the author's personal preference, such as a minor change in the color of displayed text without a particular reason, etc.

For any given pull request related to model addition, ask yourself "is this model a new addition to the domain?" and "is this a state-of-the-art model for the proposed application?" If so, does the pull request (or associated issue) describe the benefit brought by the model? If not, please add that information.

Before merging code, remember to check for the following:

- Are new unit tests in place that test all new features introduced?
- Does the code pass through `flake8`?
- Is documentation in place for the new feature or model?
