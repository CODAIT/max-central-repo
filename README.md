##  :exclamation: We are Open Source and We Welcome Contributions  :exclamation:

Our mission at [CODAIT](http://codait.org) is to democratize AI, to make AI technologies accessible to practitioners who understand real-world problems and enable them to develop AI solutions that solve these problems.

The core technologies behind today’s AI systems rely heavily on open-source software projects. Going from raw data to training data to models to solutions requires many open technologies, and it’s crucial that these technologies not only work well, but work well together. Our developers and data scientists are continually improving these frameworks with our targeted open source contributions, making them work better both individually and as an integrated pipeline. Hence our name — the Center for Open-Source Data and AI Technologies.

Subscribe to our newsletters to keep updated with the recent announcements [here](https://developer.ibm.com/newsletters/).

# Model Asset Exchange

The Model Asset Exchange on IBM Developer is a place for developers to find and use free, open source, state-of-the-art deep learning models for common application domains.
The curated list includes deployable models that you can run as a microservice locally or in the cloud on contanerization platforms like Docker, Kubernetes or OpenShift, and trainable models where you can use your own data to train the models.

Models are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Domains covered: Text, Vision, Audio, and Time-Series. 

Models can be consumed via:
 
1. Any [programming language](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
2. [WebApp](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/create-a-web-app-to-interact-with-objects-detected-using-machine-learning/)
3. [Node-RED Flow](http://ibm.biz/max-for-node-red)
4. [Serverless App](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/deploy-a-model-asset-exchange-microservice-on-red-hat-openshift/)

### Videos

1. [Video - Image Cropping Web App (Nick Kasten)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxnzpbl0YEQ) (based on the [demp application](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/max-image-segmenter-magic-cropping-tool-web-app/) code pattern)

   *About* : Use a free, open-source deep learning model to detect different types of objects in an image, then interact with them in a drag-and-drop web application.
   
2. [Video - Object Detector Web App demo (Alex Bozarth)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs6sVWmfVFw)

   *About* : The IBM Model Asset eXchange (MAX) has given application developers without data science experience easy access to prebuilt machine learning models. 
   This web app uses the Object Detector from MAX and creates a simple web UI that displays bounding boxes around detected objects in an image and lets you filter 
   the objects based on their label and probable accuracy given by the model.

3. [Video - Lighting Talk: IBM Code Model Asset Exchange (Brendan Dwyer)](https://youtu.be/4MFgJNDPGjU)

   *About*: This talk walks you through the process of building Model Asset Exchange

4. [Video - Bringing an AI Ecosystem to the Domain Expert and Enterprise AI Developer (Frederick Reiss & Vijay Bommireddipalli)](https://youtu.be/mNLl9E5p-xE)

   *About* : In this talk, we’ll break down the challenges a domain expert faces today in applying AI to real-world problems. 
   We’ll talk about the challenges that a domain expert needs to overcome in order to go from “I know a model of this type exists” to “I can tell an application developer how to apply this model to my domain.”
   
5. [Video - Deploying Machine Learning Models in Practice (Nick Pentreath)](https://youtu.be/9tOlyKxkRcc)

   *About* : The talk will cover various options for the most popular and widely used ML libraries, including MLeap, TF Serving and open standards such as PMML, PFA and the recently announced ONNX for Deep Learning. I will also introduce Aardpfark, initially covering Spark ML pipelines - as well as experimental work for exporting Spark ML pipelines to TensorFlow graphs for use with TF Serving.

6. [Video - Lessons Learned Building an Open Deep Learning Model Exchange (Nick Pentreath)](https://youtu.be/6vvl8OdmS14)
 
   *About* : This talk walks you through the process of building MAX and shares challenges and problems encountered, 
   the solutions developed, and the lessons learned, along with best practices for cross-framework, standardized deep learning model training and deployment.

7. [Video - Deploy Deep Learning models as Microservices in minutes - Gabriela de Queiroz, Karthik Muthuraman and Saishruthi Swaminathan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8nuj_RxbUk&t=1117s)
